=====
<em>An OSGi Configuration Admin Service implementation.</em>

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/papoose/papoose-config.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/papoose/papoose-config)

The Configuration Admin service is an important aspect of the deployment
of an OSGi Service Platform. It allows an Operator to set the configuration
information of deployed bundles.

Configuration is the process of defining the configuration data of bundles
and assuring that those bundles receive that data when they are active in the
OSGi Service Platform.
